# Supplementary Materials: Hierarchical EfficientNet for Earthquake Prediction

## S1. Dataset Detailed Distribution
The consolidated dataset (Experiment 3) used for final validation includes:
- **Normal (Quiet)**: 1,000 samples (Source: SSH Scan 2024-2025)
- **Moderate (M4.5-4.9)**: 500 samples
- **Medium (M5.0-5.9)**: 318 samples
- **Large (M6.0+)**: 447 samples
- **Total**: 2,265 samples

## S2. EfficientNet-B0 Hyperparameters
The following hyperparameters were used for training in Phase 2.1 and Experiment 3:
- **Backend**: PyTorch 2.1
- **Optimizer**: AdamW (weight_decay=1e-4)
- **Initial LR**: 0.001 (Reduce On Plateau)
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Image Size**: 224 x 224 pixels
- **Loss Weights**: Binary (2.0), Magnitude (1.0), Azimuth (0.5)

## S3. SMOTE Augmentation Logic
For the training set, synthetic samples were generated by interpolating between nearest neighbors (k=5) in the latent spectral space.
- Original Training Samples: 1,365
- Synthetic Training Samples: 826
- Final Training Pool: 2,191

## S4. Station Geocoordinates
Geomagnetic data was sourced from BMKG network (Station directory available in `mdata2/lokasi_stasiun.csv`).

## S5. Grad-CAM Interpretation
Attention maps generated for Large events consistently show high intensity in the 0.01-0.05 Hz frequency range, 1-2 hours prior to the seismic mainshock.
