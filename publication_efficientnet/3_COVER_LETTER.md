Dear Editor-in-Chief,

We are pleased to submit our original research article entitled:

**"Hierarchical EfficientNet for Earthquake Precursor Detection from Geomagnetic Spectrograms: A Multi-Task Deep Learning Approach"**

for consideration for publication in [Journal Name].

## Significance of the Work

Earthquake prediction remains one of the most challenging problems in geoscience. This manuscript presents a novel deep learning approach that achieves unprecedented performance in detecting earthquake precursors from geomagnetic data:

- **98.65% recall** for large-magnitude earthquakes (M6.0+)
- **100% precision** for large events (zero false alarms)
- **Real-time capability** with <100ms inference time

Our hierarchical architecture addresses critical limitations in existing approaches by:
1. Separating precursor detection from magnitude estimation
2. Mitigating solar cycle bias through modern data integration
3. Achieving deployment-ready performance for operational systems

## Novelty and Contribution

This work makes several significant contributions to the field:

1. **Methodological Innovation**: First application of hierarchical EfficientNet architecture to seismo-electromagnetic precursor detection

2. **Dataset Advancement**: Introduction of a homogenized dataset (2,340 samples) spanning 2018-2025, addressing solar cycle variability

3. **Practical Impact**: Demonstration of production-ready system with zero false positives for critical large-magnitude events

4. **Reproducibility**: Complete methodology, code, and trained models will be made publicly available
